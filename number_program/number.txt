#1. Print the kanji for a number -> prompt the user to input the number in arabic numerals (kanji -> 123)
#> Practice converting kanji to numerals

2. Prompt the user for a number -> Press enter to continue... -> Reveal kanji
*Expect the user to draw the kanji on paper/computer separately*
> Practice drawing the kanji for numbers

3. Print the kanji for a number -> prompt the user to input the number in hiragana
3.5 ^^^ but with katakana
> Practice converting kanji to hiragana/katakana (more practice), typing in Japanese, and ensuring you understand the phonetics
> Much more difficult to program



- Native, Sino-Japanese -> Hiragana, katakana, kanji

Native - end in -tsu:
Hitotsu, futatsu, mittsu, yottsu, itsutsu, muttsu, nanatsu, yattsu, kokonotsu, tou

Sino-Japanese:
ichi, ni, san, yon/shi, go, roku, nana/shichi, hachi, kyuu/ku, juu

Ordinal Numbers (ie, 1st, 2nd, 3rd):
- Always end in banme IF using Sino-Japanese
> Ichibanme, nibanme, sanbanme, etc
- Always end in me IF using native-Japanese




1. Convert kanji to arabic numerals
-> If selected, input n or s for native/Sino-Japanese

> "What level of difficulty would you like to play at?"
> "Level of difficulty -> Number of digits in number (1 to 5)" -> 0 to 99,999
> "Level: "
> *Generate Kanji*
> "What is the number in arabic numerals? (ie, 3): "


> If invalid number, *clear screen*

> *Reshow Kanji*
> "Invalid input!"
> "What is the number in arabic numerals? (ie, 3): "


> Elif wrong, *clear screen*

> "Incorrect guess!"
> "Lives remaining: -= 1"

> *Reshow Kanji*
> "What is the number in arabic numerals? (ie, 3): ""


> else "Correct!"
> "Press enter to continue..."
> *End program*





Notes:
- Two forms of reading:
> The Sino-Japanese (on'yomi) readings of the Chinese characters
> The Japanese yamato kotoba (native words, kun'yomi readings)


- Chinese used for cardinal numbers
- Native Japanese reading (Kun reading) used somewhat less formally for numbers up to 10.
- 〇 maru -> It may be optionally used when reading individual digits of a number one after another, instead of as a full number -> Only write 零 or 0

- Writing Forms:
> The Arabic numerals are more often used in horizontal writing, and the Chinese numerals are more common in vertical writing.

- Daiji (大字) -> used in legal and financial documents to prevent unscrupulous individuals from adding a stroke or two, turning a one into a two or a three
    1 	一 	壱
    2 	二 	弐
    3 	三 	参
    4 	四 	四
    5 	五 	五
    6 	六 	六
    7 	七 	七
    8 	八 	八
    9 	九 	九
    10 	十 	拾
100 	百 	百
1000 	千 	千
10000 	万 	万, 萬










How to actually generate these large numbers:
- Creating a large list of 99999 numbers is not viable
> Use grammar rules to create larger numbers


if 2 digits:
    ie, 97
    -> Get first number and add juu to the end
        -> kyuu+juu + 2nd number


Until you reach the last digit, if below 10000:
    Take the current digit's value and add the appropriate suffix (sen, hyaku, juu)
        once at current digit, add digit

1,000,000,000
10000 -> ichiman
100,000,000 -> ichioku
